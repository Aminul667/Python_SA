Then there is a column which describes their most significant contribution to junk food (ie do they most often eat chocolate, drink softdrink, or something else), and the third column details an estimate for how many times a month they partake in junk food."

By drilling down into our data when we initially don't find results and comparing a large number of hypotheses we are bound to eventually call something statistically significant. In this case, the data was generated without any correlation at all, this is just a statistical fluctuation. But in an effort to find results we could publish an article claiming a statistically significant correlation between cake and acne, and then the media would run with it, and its all junk science.\n",
